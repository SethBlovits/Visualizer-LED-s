# Visualizer-LED-s
Personal coding project to make lights that react to music

This project uses Python to read audio values from the sound card on your computer,
then creates a graph of the values that updates in realtime. This graph takes the form of 
an audio spectrum analyzer of sorts. The second graph is still a work in progress and doesn't function
properly. The data is then used to tell an arduino uno when to activate the string of LEDs. 
This communication is done with using the HC-05 bluetooth module.

***This project is still a work in progress. I will be implementing a GUI as well as
attempting to make an executable file.
